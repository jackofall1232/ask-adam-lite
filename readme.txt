Ask Adam Lite is a secure, minimal AI chat widget and lightweight knowledge base for WordPress. 
It works out of the box with your own OpenAI API key and provides a simple, standalone solution. 

== Description ==

Ask Adam Lite makes it easy to add an AI-powered assistant to your WordPress site.  
You can display it as a floating widget or drop it into any page/post with the shortcode.

**Features in Lite:**
- Floating AI chat widget or `[ask_adam_lite]` shortcode
- Uses OpenAI (GPT-4o mini) with your own API key
- Basic knowledge base: index up to 1 sitemap and 1 priority URL
- Simple settings for position, name, and avatar
- No external accounts or subscriptions beyond your OpenAI key

**Need more?**  
Ask Adam Lite is fully functional as-is.  
If you want to expand with multiple AI providers, real-time web search, advanced profiles, or theme customization, those features are available in the Pro version at [askadamit.com](https://www.askadamit.com).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the ZIP via Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin.
2. Activate.
3. Go to **Ask Adam Lite → Settings** and enter your OpenAI API key.
4. Use the `[ask_adam_lite]` shortcode or enable the floating widget.
