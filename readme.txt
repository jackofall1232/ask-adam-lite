Ask Adam Lite is a secure, minimal AI chat widget and lightweight knowledge base for WordPress. 
It works out of the box with your own OpenAI API key and provides a simple, standalone solution.

Ask Adam Lite makes it easy to add an AI-powered assistant to your WordPress site.  
You can display it as a floating widget or drop it into any page/post with the shortcode.

**Features in Lite:**

- Uses OpenAI (GPT-4o mini) with your own API key

- No external accounts or subscriptions beyond your OpenAI key

**Need more?**

2. Activate.
3. Go to **Ask Adam Lite → Settings** and enter your OpenAI API key.
